# ai_backend_demo/app/core/prompts.py
"""
Prompts used by the generation pipeline.

Goals:
- Force JSON-only structured outputs the backend can parse.
- Provide a clear dependency policy: return dependency *names only* (no versions).
- Provide a structured followup-question format so the CLI can render them and prefill answers.
